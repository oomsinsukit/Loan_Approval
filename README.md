# Credit Risk Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict credit risk using the dataset provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset/data). The notebook walks through the entire process, from data exploration to model evaluation, providing a comprehensive guide to building a predictive model for loan approval.

## Features of the Project

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Detailed analysis of the dataset to understand key features, distributions, and correlations.
   - Identification of missing values and strategies for handling them.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Transforming raw data into features suitable for machine learning models.
   - Encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical variables.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk.
   - Techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to improve model performance.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness.
   - Visualization of results using graphs and charts for better interpretability.
