# Project for Portfolio
Develop a predictive model for loan approval using a credit risk dataset from Kaggle.
The objective is to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze credit risk factors and predict whether a loan will be approved.
This model will consider key features such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and other relevant factors to determine approval likelihood.
The process will involve data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting), and performance evaluation using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score
